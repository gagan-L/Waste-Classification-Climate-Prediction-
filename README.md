=====================================================

**Garbage Dataset Instructions:**
Dataset Location:
Place the dataset folder under the garbage_classification directory.

Preprocess and Train the Data:
Run preprocess_garbage_data.py to preprocess the images and train the model:

This will normalize the image data, apply data augmentation, and save the trained CNN model.
Analyze Processed and Trained Data:
Run analyze_garbage_data.py to analyze the results of the processed and trained data:

This script uses the trained model to classify garbage into categories.
Model and Results Location:

The trained CNN model is saved in the model folder.
The classification results, including predictions, can be found in the results folder.

Preprocess Climate Data:
Run preprocess_climate_data.py to process the dataset:

This script calculates the yearly average temperature for each country and normalizes the values.
The preprocessed data will be saved as a CSV file in the results folder inside climate_analysis.
Analyze Processed Data:
Run analyze_climate_data.py to analyze the processed data:

This script generates a visual representation of temperature trends for selected countries.

**Requirement Descriptions (R2â€“R5)** 

**R2. Data Analysis and Exploration**
Comprehensive preprocessing and cleaning were conducted for all datasets (garbage, climate, and pollution) to ensure data quality. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed patterns such as the effect of temperature on organic waste decomposition and the classification of garbage into 12 categories. Feature selection identified key inputs like AverageTemperature, PlasticWastePercent, and GlassWastePercent.
Repository Location: https://github.com/gagan-L/Waste-Classification-Climate-Prediction-/blob/main/pollution_analysis/analysis/analyze_pollution_data.py
Model Inputs: AverageTemperature, PlasticWastePercent, GlassWastePercent.
Model Outputs: OrganicWastePercent (prediction) and garbage categories (classification).
Visualization: Included heatmaps for correlations, scatter plots, and bar charts.

**R3. Clustering**
K-means clustering was applied to analyze similarities across countries in terms of waste management. Climate and pollution datasets were clustered to identify countries with similar organic waste levels and temperature profiles. Performance was evaluated using silhouette scores.

**R4. Baseline Training and Evaluation Experiments**
Three machine learning algorithmsâ€”Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), and Linear Regressionâ€”were used. Regression was employed for predicting OrganicWastePercent, and classification models were applied to the garbage dataset. The decision tree's feature importance provided practical applications in waste decomposition prediction.

A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was applied to the combined dataset for regression tasks, predicting OrganicWastePercent with improved accuracy. Performance was compared to baseline models.
