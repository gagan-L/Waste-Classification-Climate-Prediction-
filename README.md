# Waste-Classification-Climate-Prediction-

1. Garbage Dataset 
2. run Preprocessing_and _train.py to traing the model using CNN
3. Once completed run visulization.py to visualize the chart 
4. run app.py wherein we have a local server running and images can be uploaded to clasify based on garbage type.
5. Come back and check logs.

=====================================================

Garbage Dataset

1. Uploaded the dataset folder under garbage classification
2. Run preprocess_garbage_data.py to process and train the data first
3. Run analyze_garbage_data.py to analyse the proccessed and trained data.
4. Please check model folder for the trained CNN model.
5. Once this is run please check the results folder for classification of garbage based on category.
